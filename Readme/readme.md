Instrcuctions for using code-scripts:


QPM_exactMatching.ipynb
QPM_generalCode.ipynb
QPM_withSpecificSet.ipynb

-All the codes are written in Python (i-python version) using Jupyter Notebook with Qiskit library.
	Installation of libraries and packages:
		sudo pip install jupyter
		sudo pip install qiskit
	Run jupyter shell:
		jupyter notebook

-For running the codes, an active jupyter console is needed with command for running all cells.

-For quantum results, simulation as well as actual runs are performed with IBM registered id.



QPM_IBM_demo.qasm

-The code is written in OpenQasm which is supported by IBM Q Experience.

-To run the code in IBM Q Experience console (Circuit composer tab: https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer) , one needs to import this file. It will give circuit visualization and chart for resultant probabilities.
